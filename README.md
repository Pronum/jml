# jml
JML is a custom file format like json, bson or yaml.

# To get started :
- At first, JML works with spaces, symbols & you don't need to put double quotes!
- Aswell as always this is just the beta of jml file format, more updates is comming soon!
### Example code for .jml file :
```yml
spacing is avaliable | this is spacing
$ymbols? | $ymb0ls & numb3r$ 4r3 w0rk1ng
```

### Example code in typescript :
```typescript
import { initJMLFile, indexJMLFile, getFromJML } from "jml-format";
import path from "path";

const main = ( ) => {
    const fpath = path.join(__dirname + "/conf.jml");

    initJMLFile(fpath);
    setTimeout(( ) => {
        const r: any = indexJMLFile();
        const string: any = r;
        console.log(getFromJML(string.list.items, "spacing is avaliable"));
        console.log(getFromJML(string.list.items, "$ymbols?"));
    }, 32);
};

main();
```

### Output:
-     this is spacing
-     $ymb0ls & numb3r$ 4r3 w0rk1ng

## Pros & cons :
- jml works with :
-   spacing
-   numbers
-   symbols
- jml can not work with :
-   more than space after you finished the field or value, Like :
-     GOOD  ðŸ‘‡:
-            this is a test | yep!
-     BAD   ðŸ‘‡:
-            this is a test     |     yep!
-   no ability to put comments (Working on it)
